#MKV SRT Extractor

A Ruby script that extracts ASS subtitles from MKV containers using MKVtoolnix and converts them to SRT subtitles. 

Due to Samsung TVs SDK subtitle file restrictions, Plex lacks of embedded subtitles and SSA/ASS subtitles support. This script was made for Samsung TV's Plex client users, but can be used or adapted for other needs.

##Requirements
[MKVToolnix](http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/) 

##Usage

On terminal run `ruby SRTExtractor.rb /path/to/directory` directory where the .mkv files are.

Follow onscreen instructions
